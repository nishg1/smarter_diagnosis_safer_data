# federated_learning_hospital_data

Heart disease continues to be one of the leading causes of death across all ethnic groups and people in various geographic locations. Given certain features, namely age, sex, cp, trestbps, chol, fbs, restecg, thalach, exang, oldpeak, slope, ca, and thal,we have curated a model that predicts whether or not a patient has heart disease. In the case that we predict that the patient does have heart disease, we recommend consulting a doctor for further steps. 

Our model incorporates federated learning, as we have a global model whose parameters are updated based on the aggregation of the parameters of the locally trained models. We use Logistic Regression as our model and have achieved a minimum accuracy of 88%.
